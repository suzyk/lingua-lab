# LinguaLab 🎮📚

**Interactive English Learning Games**

LinguaLab is a student portal for homework and collection of mini-games designed to make English learning engaging, fun, and accessible.  
I built this project as part of my portfolio to showcase my skills in **React, TypeScript, and modern frontend development** while also solving a real-world problem I care about—making language practice more interactive for kids and learners.

## 🎮 How the Games Work

Each game is designed to be straightforward and intuitive, so learners can start playing immediately:

- **Flashcard Game** – Page through cards and click them to hear the sound of the vocab.
- **Matching Game** – Match pairs of images and words.

React hooks manage the state, progress, and scoring so the games remain **dynamic and replayable**.

## 🧩 Tech Stack

- **React** – Functional components & hooks
- **TypeScript** – Type safety and cleaner development
- **TailwindCSS** – Utility-first responsive styling
- **Vite** – Fast bundler & dev server

## ⚙️ Core React Concepts Used

This project demonstrates modern React practices:

- **`useState`** – track score, game progress, and user choices
- **`useEffect`** – timers, reset logic, and side effects (e.g., animations)
- **`useContext`** – share global game state and themes across components
- **Custom hooks** – for reusable logic such as shuffling and resets
- **Component composition** – games are modular and self-contained

## 🌱 Future Improvements

- Add new game types (listening, typing challenges, sentence building)
- Multi-language support
- User accounts and personalized progress tracking
